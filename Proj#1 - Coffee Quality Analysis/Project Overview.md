# Proj#1 - Coffee Quality Analysis
## 1.	Objective:   
1. To identify the key determinants of coffee quality as evaluated through sensory attributes such as aroma, flavor, and acidity.
2. To explore the correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores. 
## 2.	Data Overview:
- **Dataset**: Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) Arabica coffee dataset
- **Key variables**:
  + **Total Cup Points**: Overall coffee quality score
  + **Processing Method**: Coffee bean processing technique (Washed, Natural, Honey, etc.)
  + **Altitude**: Elevation where coffee was grown
  + **Sensory Attributes**: Aroma, Acidity, Flavor, Body, Aftertaste, Balance
  + **Defects**: Category One & Two defects, Quakers
## 3.	Skill Demonstrated:
- **Data Analysis**: Identifying trends and correlations in coffee quality scores.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performing correlation analysis to determine quality score drivers.
- **Data Visualization**: Presenting insights through charts and graphs.
- **Business Intelligence**: Translating data insights into actionable recommendations.
## 4.	Tools Used:
- SQL
- Power BI & Python for Visualization
## 5.	Report:

## 6.	Key Findings:
### 6.1 Quality Score Distribution
- Most coffees score between **80-90 points**.
- Few samples exceed **90 points**, indicating exceptional quality.
- Distribution is **right-skewed**, meaning more mid-range coffees than top-tier.
### 6.2 Key determinants of coffee quality
- Sensory attributes (**Flavor, Aroma, Acidity, Body, Balance, and Aftertaste**) have the strongest positive correlations with quality scores.
- Altitude shows a weak positive correlation, reinforcing that **other factors contribute more significantly to high quality**.
### 6.3 Impact of Altitude on Coffee Quality
- **Slight positive correlation (0.10)** → Higher altitude coffee tends to have better quality.
- Some **low-altitude coffees still score high**, meaning altitude alone isn’t the key factor.
